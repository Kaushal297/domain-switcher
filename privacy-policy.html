    <h1>Domain Switcher - Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="date">Last Updated: June 2023</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Domain Switcher is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what information we
        collect, how we use it, and what choices you have regarding your information.
    </p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
        Domain Switcher is designed to minimize data collection. We collect and store only the following information:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Domain configurations</strong>: The domain names and URLs you add to the extension are stored in
            your browser's local storage using Chrome's storage sync API. This data is only stored on your device and
            synchronized across your signed-in Chrome browsers.</li>
        <li><strong>Tab URLs</strong>: When you use the extension, it temporarily accesses the URL of your current tab
            to preserve the path when switching domains. This information is never stored, transmitted, or shared
            outside your browser.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>
        The information we collect is used solely for the following purposes:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>To provide the core functionality of the extension (switching between domains while preserving paths and
            parameters)</li>
        <li>To save your domain configurations for future use</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Sharing and Transfer</h2>
    <p>
        Domain Switcher does not:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Send any data to external servers</li>
        <li>Share any information with third parties</li>
        <li>Use analytics or tracking services</li>
        <li>Store any data outside your browser's storage</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Your Choices and Control</h2>
    <p>
        You have complete control over the data stored by Domain Switcher:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>You can delete individual domains from the extension interface</li>
        <li>You can clear all stored data by uninstalling the extension</li>
        <li>You can inspect what data is stored by visiting chrome://extensions, enabling Developer Mode, and clicking
            "Inspect views" on the Domain Switcher extension</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>
        Since all data is stored locally in your browser and is not transmitted over the internet, the security risk is
        minimal. However, we've implemented the extension following Chrome's recommended security practices:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Using Content Security Policy (CSP) to prevent execution of unauthorized scripts</li>
        <li>Setting appropriate security headers to prevent common web vulnerabilities</li>
        <li>Following the principle of least privilege in permission requests</li>
        <li>Regular updates to address any security concerns</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new
        Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date.
    </p>
